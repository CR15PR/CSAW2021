Notes: <br>

Overall we placed 211th of 1216 teams with 1+ points.  We competed as a duo, [root2thrill](https://github.com/ivanchubb) and dancing.pickle. We were strong on forensics and stego, but weak on web, reversing, and pwn.  I felt like with more time we could have done better on a couple of the RSA problems.  Infrastructure was a bit unstable at times, but we still learned a lot and are grateful to participate in CSAW 2021. Looking forward to next year!
